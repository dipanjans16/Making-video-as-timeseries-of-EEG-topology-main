# Making-video-of-timeseries-of-EEG-topology
This code is an example to show how  to show easy topologies as time series of topologies in the form of a video. 

How to use this code- 
Download the basic function and EEG sensor locations for microstates using the github repository. eeg_microstates3.py contains all the basic function to be used for microstate analysis. 

Data set download-
